Another simple project from my Flutter learning trajectory similar
to my previous digital business card application. This app basically
rolls the two dice when clicked on them and settles the score with
your friends.

## Some Useful Flutter Resources

Documentation is a programmer's best friend when learning something new. Here are 
a few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
